                <h4>Clear racism at Al Fayed's Harrods, former staff tell BBC
                </h4>
                <img src="images/london6.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                <p>Former staff members at Harrods, once owned by Mohamed Al-Fayed, have come forward with allegations
                    of clear racism during their time at the iconic London department store. Speaking to the BBC,
                    several former employees described a workplace culture where discriminatory behavior was reportedly
                    tolerated, creating a hostile environment for minority staff. These revelations have sparked outrage
                    and calls for accountability, tarnishing the legacy of one of the world’s most famous luxury
                    retailers.</p>

                <p>The allegations include claims of racial bias in promotions, unequal treatment, and derogatory
                    remarks made by colleagues and managers. Some staff recounted being overlooked for career
                    advancement in favor of less-qualified counterparts from non-minority backgrounds. Others described
                    incidents where complaints about racism were dismissed or ignored, leaving them feeling powerless
                    and unsupported.</p>

                <p>Harrods has historically been associated with opulence and exclusivity, but these allegations reveal
                    a troubling undercurrent of inequality during the Al-Fayed era. Critics argue that the store’s
                    management failed to address systemic issues, allowing discrimination to persist. The former owner,
                    Mohamed Al-Fayed, who passed away recently, had publicly positioned himself as an advocate for
                    fairness, but these claims cast a shadow over his stewardship of the establishment.</p>

                <p>The revelations have reignited debates about racism in high-profile workplaces, particularly in
                    industries associated with wealth and privilege. Activists and former employees are calling for a
                    thorough investigation into the allegations and urging the store’s current management to implement
                    robust measures to ensure such behavior is not repeated. As the story continues to unfold, it serves
                    as a stark reminder of the need for vigilance and accountability in addressing workplace
                    discrimination, regardless of an organization’s prestige or public image. </p>
