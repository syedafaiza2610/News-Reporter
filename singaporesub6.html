                <h3>Drugs with decongestant pseudoephedrine can be taken but with<br> caution: Experts</h3>
                <img src="singaporeimages/sg6.avif" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p>SINGAPORE – There is no need to discard medications containing decongestant pseudoephedrine unless
                    an<br>
                    individual has serious medical conditions like uncontrolled hypertension or kidney failure that
                    increase the risk<br> of serious side effects, said medical experts.</p>
                <p>However, they stressed the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage and seeking
                    immediate medical<br> attention if unusual symptoms such as nausea and visual disturbances emerge.
                </p>
                <p>Some readers of The Straits Times have expressed concern after reading a report about pharmaceutical
                    giant GSK’s<br> decision to stop producing Zyrtec-D, its popular antihistamine and decongestant,
                    which
                    contains pseudoephedrine,<br> a drug that has been linked to rare but severe side effects.</p>
                <p>Pseudoephedrine is found in about 30 medications registered in Singapore. Others that contain
                    pseudoephedrine<br> include Clarityn-D, Telfast-D and Sudafed.</p>
                <p>The drug has been linked to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and reversible
                    cerebral<br> vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS).</p>
                <p>Although the risk of the drug inducing problems is small – and in most cases reversible – the two
                    conditions can be<br> serious.</p>
                    <p>PRES can cause visual problems, seizures and headaches, and affects thinking. It is treatable with early diagnosis.</p>
