                <h3>DNBC Explains: What caused the prolonged rain in Singapore?</h3>
                <img src="singaporeimages/sg5.avif" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p>SINGAPORE – Cool weather rare for humid Singapore, flash floods, delayed flights and slow business.
                </p>
                <p>All of these happened over three days starting from Jan 10, as a result of a monsoon surge that has
                    been dumping<br> rain on the island, with occasional strong wind </p>
                <p>The mercury fell to 21.6 deg C in the Newton Road area on the morning of Jan 11, almost matching
                    2024’s lowest<br> temperature of 21.4 deg C.</p>
                <p>A stretch of Jalan Seaview in Mountbatten was affected by flash floods on the evening of Jan 10.</p>
                <p>Singapore is currently in the wet phase of the north-east monsoon, which typically lasts from
                    December to January.</p>
                <p>A monsoon surge that brings prolonged rain is a common phenomenon during this season.</p>
                <p>During the north-east monsoon, winds typically blow from the north-east to the south-west.</p>
                <p>A monsoon surge refers to bursts of cold air from Central Asia. </p>
                <p>When regions up north, such as Siberia, experience extremely cold weather in the winter months, the
                    cold air<br> occasionally sweeps southwards to the South China Sea, and is blown towards the tropics.
                <p>The air then warms and picks up moisture, leading to the formation of dense rain clouds. This brings
                    increased<br> rainfall near the Equator. </p>
                <p>There could be moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms in places such as Singapore, Malaysia and<br>
                    Vietnam. The rainfall can be prolonged – like it has been in Singapore since Jan 10 – lasting from
                    two to several days.</p>
