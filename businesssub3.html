                <p>US President-elect Donald Trump has signaled his intention to withdraw from multilateral
                    public-health initiatives, putting global stability and America’s own security interests at risk. A
                    true “America First” strategy would focus on leveraging health diplomacy to secure the country's
                    industrial future.</p>

                    NAIROBI – US President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House signals a potential break from
                    decades of American leadership in global health. While Trump’s isolationist “America First” agenda
                    may resonate with voters eager to see their tax dollars redirected toward domestic priorities, a US
                    withdrawal from multilateral public-health initiatives would carry serious risks.

                <p>On September 1, we submitted our final recommendations, calling for a major overhaul of Doing
                    Business including ending the practice of ranking countries. Two weeks later, the World Bank
                    announced that it was scrapping the report entirely after a separate investigation by an outside law
                    firm concluded that data had been deliberately manipulated in order to alter some countries’
                    rankings, notably those of China and Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>The embrace of short-termism by corporations – reflected in their preference for dividends and share
                    buybacks over reinvestment of profits – has further undermined the EU manufacturing sector’s
                    dynamism and resilience. Compounding all these challenges is the biggest crisis of them all –
