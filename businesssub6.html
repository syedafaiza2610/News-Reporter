                <h3>Will Trump Fire the Fed?</h3><br>

                    Despite Donald Trump’s assurances that he will not seek to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome
                    Powell, there is little doubt that the US president-elect aims to gain greater influence over the
                    Fed’s decision-making. Such interference could drive up long-term interest rates, damaging the
                    American economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The relationship between former President Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve (commonly referred to
                    as "the Fed") was one of the most contentious in recent American political and economic history. The
                    speculation surrounding whether Trump would "fire" key Federal Reserve officials, including its
                    chairman, Jerome Powell, garnered significant attention during his presidency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Federal Reserve is the central banking system of the United States, tasked with managing
                    monetary policy, stabilizing prices, and ensuring maximum employment. It operates independently of
                    political influence, a principle designed to maintain economic stability and credibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During his presidency, Trump was openly critical of the Federal Reserve, particularly its decisions
                    to raise interest rates. He argued that the Fed’s monetary policy was detrimental to economic growth
                    and hindered his administration’s efforts to stimulate the economy. His sharpest criticism was often
                    directed at Jerome Powell, whom Trump himself appointed as Fed Chair in 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trump accused the Fed of acting too conservatively, especially when other central banks around the
                    world were pursuing more aggressive monetary easing policies. He believed that lower interest rates
                    would have further boosted the stock market and supported his economic agenda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Legally, the independence of the Federal Reserve is protected, and the President does not have the
                    authority to directly "fire" the Fed Chair. The Chair serves a four-year term and can only be
                    removed "for cause," which would require evidence of misconduct or incompetence. Merely disagreeing
                    with monetary policy decisions does not constitute sufficient grounds for removal.

                    However, Trump’s repeated public pressure on the Fed raised concerns about the erosion of the
                    central bank’s independence. Economic experts warned that politicizing the Fed could undermine its
                    credibility and destabilize financial markets.
