                <p>According to police, the suspect ignore multiple commands to stop, then ran behind a tree and pointed

                    according to police.</p>
                <p>Police say officers recovered one firearm at the scene, and a second firearm – a ghost gun – was
                    found inside the convenience store.</p>
