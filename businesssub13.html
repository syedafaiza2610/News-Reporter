                    Keun Lee urges the World Bank to adopt a more reliable measure of economic development than nominal
                    per capita GDP.

                    Solar geoengineering, the deliberate intervention in the Earth's climate system to reflect sunlight
                    and reduce global warming, has emerged as a controversial topic in the fight against climate change.
                    While it promises a potential solution to rising global temperatures, many scientists, ethicists,
                    and policymakers advocate for a ban on its development and deployment due to significant risks and
                    unresolved ethical dilemmas.
                <p>
                    The concept of solar geoengineering typically involves techniques such as injecting aerosols into
                    the stratosphere to reflect sunlight or deploying reflective materials to cool the Earth's surface.

                    stratosphere to reflect sunlight or deploying reflective materials to cool the Earth's surface.
                    Proponents argue that these methods could provide a quick and cost-effective way to mitigate the
                    effects of climate change, buying time for societies to transition to renewable energy and reduce
                    greenhouse gas emissions. However, this apparent simplicity masks the profound uncertainties and
                    potential consequences associated with such interventions.
                </p>
                <p>

                    One of the most significant concerns is the unpredictability of solar geoengineering’s effects.
                    Climate systems are immensely complex, and even minor interventions could lead to unintended
                    consequences. Altering weather patterns might exacerbate droughts in some regions while causing
                    flooding in others. These disparities could disproportionately impact vulnerable communities,
                    raising questions of climate justice and equity.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, solar geoengineering does not address the root cause of climate change—greenhouse gas
                    emissions. Instead, it acts as a temporary fix, potentially creating a "moral hazard" where
                    governments and industries delay necessary reductions in emissions. This reliance on geoengineering
                    could undermine global efforts to transition to sustainable practices, locking the planet into a
                    cycle of dependence on artificial interventions.
