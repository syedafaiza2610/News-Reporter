                <img src="newyorkimages/nysub4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p>The controversial Floyd Bennett Field migrant shelter in Brooklyn closed Saturday, just four months
                    into a new year-long lease.</p>
                <p>Mayor Eric Adams was on hand to celebrate as workers began dismantling the tent encampment. The
                    2,000-bed site had been in operation for more than a year.</p>
                <p>"And I want to just personally say sorry to them because this is something that none of us wanted,"
                    Adams said.</p>
                <p>This is one of 25 planned closures the mayor announced in December. The Randall's Island shelter is
                    also on that list. The city expects to have all 25 sites shuttered by March.</p>
                <p>The city says a "smaller brick-and-mortar congregate facility" will open on Bruckner Boulevard in the
                    Bronx for single adult men. Migrants who are still living at the Randall's Island shelter at the
                    time of its closure will be transferred to this new facility.</p>
                <p>On top of those 25 closures, Adams announced this week the city will shut down 13 more shelters by
                    June. Those 13 shelters have a combined total of about 10,000 beds.</p>
