                <p>
                    This partnership, which eclipsed previous records, provided Pakistan a much-needed fightback after
                    being bowled out for just 194 in their first innings.
                    Their 205-run stand not only defied the pressure of the follow-on but also gave the visiting side a
                    glimmer of hope to level the series.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shan’s remarkable century, his sixth in Test cricket, and Babar’s 81 runs, which included 10
                    boundaries, were instrumental in keeping South Africa on the back foot.
                    The pair's display of determination and composure on a pitch now easing for batting left the hosts
                    helpless.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Babar, who was well on his way to scoring a long-awaited Test hundred, was dismissed at gully, but
                    not before creating history.
                    His partnership with Shan marked the highest-ever opening stand in a follow-on innings in Test
                    cricket, setting a new world record.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This historic moment not only thrilled fans but also solidified the legacy of Shan Masood and Babar
                    Azam as one of the most formidable opening pairs in cricket. Their achievement will be remembered as
                    a shining example of skill, partnership, and the spirit of the game.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Babar Azam’s innings was a testament to his status as one of the best batsmen in modern cricket. His
                    exquisite timing, ability to find gaps, and consistency under pressure were on full display. Shan
                    Masood, too, proved his mettle, anchoring the innings with determination and capitalizing on scoring
                    opportunities with precision.
                </p>
