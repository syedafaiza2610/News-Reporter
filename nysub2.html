                <img src="newyorkimages/nysub2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p>- PATH train fare hikes started Sunday, after the first week of New York City congestion pricing and
                    other toll hikes. </p>
                <p>It marks the first time PATH fares have gone up since October 2014. </p>
                <p>According to PATH, the increase is the result of inflation, the need for capital improvements and to
                    make up for a $3 billion loss during the COVID pandemic. </p>
                <h3>PATH fare hikes breakdown
                </h3>
                <p>A single ride on the PATH costs $3.00 after the 25-cent fare hike. A 10-trip card costs $28.50 after
                    a $2.50 bump, and a 30-day pass is now $120.75, which is $10.50 more. </p>
                <p>Seniors are eligible for a discounted $1.50 fare. For the first time, disabled passengers are
                    eligible for a 50% fare discount.   </p>
