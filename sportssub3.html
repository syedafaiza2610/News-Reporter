                <h3>The End of Amateur Hour for the NCAA</h3>
                <img src="sportsimages/sp4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                <p>The NCAA is asking the US Supreme Court to endorse the fiction that it is preserving
                    amateurism in athletics.</p>
                <p>
                    For decades, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) maintained a strict adherence to
                    the principle of amateurism, barring college athletes from earning money while participating in
                    sports. However, recent developments have brought an end to the "amateur hour," fundamentally
                    transforming the collegiate sports landscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2021, the NCAA announced a seismic shift by allowing college athletes to profit from their name,
                    image, and likeness (NIL). This decision followed mounting legal challenges, public criticism, and
                    state-level legislation advocating for athletes' rights. The NIL policy enables student-athletes to
                    sign endorsement deals, monetize their social media presence, and earn income from other ventures,
                    marking a historic departure from the NCAA’s amateurism model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The end of amateurism signals a new era for the NCAA, requiring it to adapt to a more
                    professionalized and commercialized model. To remain relevant, the NCAA must prioritize fairness,
                    transparency, and support systems to help athletes navigate this complex new world.

                    The "end of amateur hour" is not just a turning point for collegiate sports; it’s a long-overdue
                    recognition of the value and contributions of student-athletes. By embracing this change, the NCAA
                    has an opportunity to redefine its role and create a more equitable and sustainable future for all
                    stakeholders in college sports.
