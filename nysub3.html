                <h3>Donations pour in for California fire victims as NYC bar turns into collection site</h3><br>

                <p>â€” New Yorkers came out Saturday to support California fire victims as a local bar spent the day
                    collecting donations that will be shipped out to impacted regions.</p>
                <p>Ray's Bar on the Lower East Side turned into a donation site, overflowing with boxes full of
                    essentials for those who need them most. The bar also donated $1 per drink sale to the nonprofit
                    Baby2Baby, as tens of thousands are left without homes and mass evacuations are underway in
                    wildfire-devastated regions of Southern California.</p>
                <h3>New Yorkers donate essential supplies for California fire victims</h3>
                <p>"I saw something yesterday, and it said 'do for one person what you wish you could do for everyone,'
                    and so that's kind of how this started," event organizer Kate Moskowitz said.</p>
                <p>Kate Moskowitz, from the West Village, put her advertising and media expertise to use for good on
                    Saturday in partnership with her favorite bar, where donors showed up fully loaded with supplies.
                </p>
                <p>"New towels, new socks, new underwear, a dog bed, dog toy," donor Michelle Tagmyer said.
