                <p>- PATH train fare hikes started Sunday, after the first week of New York City congestion pricing and
                    other toll hikes. </p>
                <p>It marks the first time PATH fares have gone up since October 2014. </p>
                <p>According to PATH, the increase is the result of inflation, the need for capital improvements and to
                    make up for a $3 billion loss during the COVID pandemic. </p>
        
                <p>A single ride on the PATH costs $3.00 after the 25-cent fare hike. A 10-trip card costs $28.50 after
                    a $2.50 bump, and a 30-day pass is now $120.75, which is $10.50 more. </p>
                <p>Seniors are eligible for a discounted $1.50 fare. For the first time, disabled passengers are
                    eligible for a 50% fare discount. </p>
                <p> All Hallows High School and its legacy that started in the early 20th century could come to an end
                    if the Catholic school in the Bronx can't come up with $2.5 million.</p>
                <p>While All Hallows High School is half way to its goal, many in the South Bronx community are
                    devastated over the prospects of losing it. The school has until Jan. 16 to come up with the funds,
                    otherwise it would shut down at the end of the academic year.</p>
