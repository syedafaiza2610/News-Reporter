                <p>Chinese Vice President Han Zheng on Saturday met with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel
                    Reeves, who is in Beijing for the 11th China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue.</p>
                <p>China and the UK are both major economies and financial heavyweights in the world, Han said, pointing
                    out that strengthening economic and financial cooperation in the spirit of strategic partnership is
                    of great significance to promoting economic growth, improving people's lives and encouraging green
                    development in these two countries.</p>
                <p>It will also inject confidence and impetus into the development of the world economy, Han added.

                </p>
                <p>China is willing to continue to expand openness and exchanges with the UK, enhance mutual
                    understanding and trust, and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation to bring more benefits to the
                    two countries and the world, said Han.</p>
                <p>Reeves, meanwhile, said the resumption of this dialogue after nearly six years is of great
                    significance.</p>
                <p>The British side attaches importance to developing relations with China and is willing to strengthen
                    candid dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation with China to promote the economic development
                    of each country, she added.</p>
                <p>The high-level dialogue mechanism, established in 2008, is an important platform for dialogue and
                    cooperation on strategic, overall and long-term major issues in the economic and financial fields.
