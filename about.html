                <p>Newsrooms across the world are gravely understaffed. The research desk is largely a thing of the
                    past, and <br> many local reporters are stretched too thin to develop subject matter expertise in
                    their
                    multiple beats. <br> Fortunately, academic researchers do have such expertise, which they share in
                    the
                    form of scientific studies. <br>For resource-constrained journalists, academic research should be an

                    and forged content partnerships with Quartz, Forbes, HBR Ascend, and the World Economic Forum. Her
                    work also has appeared in The Boston Globe, Boston Magazine, Inc., NPR Science Friday, PC Magazine,

                    state-level journalism awards and, in 2013, was named as a Pulitzer Prize finalist for an
                    investigative series she led. Ordway, a 2014-15 Fellow of Harvard’s Nieman Foundation for

                    “I just wanted to express my thanks for this consistently useful newsletter. I am a member of
                    several professional organizations and The Journalist’s Resource has definitely risen to the top. I
                    very much appreciate the work and thought done by the people of this organization. Though my beat is
                    science and solutions, I find that I learn how to do my job better, each time I read one of your
                    emails.” <b>— Jenny Morber, </b>freelance journalist.</p>
                <p>“Journalists love data and research but are notoriously strapped for time. Our reporters in
                    particular have taken on assignments for this project in addition to their existing, full workloads.
                    Through their journalist research briefs, The Journalist’s Resource at the Shorenstein Center has
                    been a critical resource to help fill in the gaps and strengthen the quality of the reporters’
                    mental health coverage. Our partners have pitched an array of topics and somehow the center has been
                    able to provide resources for nearly all of them, along with producing new briefs for our upcoming
                    websites. We are greatly appreciative of all the help they’ve given the team.” <b>—Nora Fleming,</b>
                    newsroom collaborative manager, Mental Health Parity Collaborative</p>



                <p>“There is no site I’d rather discuss my research with than The Journalist’s Resource. The writers ask
                    insightful questions, always with an eye towards a broader audience and translating research
                    findings into tangible actions and solutions. Whenever JR writes about my research, I know that
                    other media outlets and interested groups will soon be in touch. I also regularly assign their
                    articles in my classes! I’m so glad that JR exists, and always look forward to speaking with them
                    again.”<b>— Joshua Darr,</b> associate professor of political communication at Syracuse University
                </p>


                <p>“The DNBC is a necessary bridge between academic research and journalism.
                    Journalists, especially those working in local news, are hungry for data on deadline and need
                    information to contextualize what’s happening in their communities. News organizations are critical
                    to helping bring the knowledge generated in academia to a broader audience. JR facilitates a
                    critical partnership for healthier, more informed communities.”<b>— Leah Todd,</b> Local Media
                    Project
                    team and New England region manager, Solutions Journalism Network</p>

                <p>“The tip sheets and other services The Journalist’s Resource provides have helped our reporters and
                    editors tackle complex topics in which they may not previously have been immersed. And that’s a
                    fundamental predicament for journalists who can wake up to a completely new and urgent subject every
                    day. As the speed of the news cycle has accelerated, this has become a bigger problem for newsrooms.

                <p>In this research-based explainer, we examine the rise in chronic student absenteeism in recent years
                    and the various ways school nurses, an underutilized resource in the push to improve attendance, can

                    long been missing from many depleted newsrooms. Most of all, Journalist’s Resource helps us build
