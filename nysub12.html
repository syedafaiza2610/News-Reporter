                <h3>What happened at Trump's "hush money" sentencing? A timeline of his trial from inside the court</h3><br>
                <img src="newyorkimages/nysub12.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p>- President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced to unconditional discharge Friday, a symbolic end to his New York "hush money" case. </p>
                <p>The sentence carries neither jail time nor any other restrictions that might impede his inauguration on Jan. 20.</p>
                    <p>"In the wealthiest country in the world, this can no longer be tolerated. Not in America and definitely not in the great state of New York," the governor said. </p>
                  
                    <p>Hochul announced her free school meals on Friday, as part on her efforts to make the state more affordable, before next week's State of the State Address.</p>
                    <p>The Macy's location at the Essex Green Shopping Center in Orange, New Jersey is also on the list.</p>
                    <p>Macy's said it's shuttering stores that are "underproductive."</p>
                    <h3>What happened in the courtroom
                    </h3>
                    <p>The new plan is upsetting some local shoppers.</p>
                    <p>"Very sad, I love Macy's," Queens resident Maryann Lattanzin said.</p>
                    <p>"I used to work for Macy's, and that was, like, the best job I ever had," Queens resident Amanda
                        Williams said.</p>
                    <p>The governor said she will ask lawmakers to approve free meals for all students, regardless of income, in her speech, because students perform better with full bellies.</p>
