                <h3>Commentators’ Predictions for 2025</h3><br>

                    In a rapidly changing global landscape marked by geopolitical, economic, and political turbulence,
                    forecasting is a perilous endeavor. But as Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House in
                    2025, one thing can be said with certainty: it will be a bumpy ride.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we step into the heart of the decade, commentators and thought leaders from various fields are
                    offering insights into what 2025 may hold. From technological advancements to geopolitical shifts,
                    the predictions paint a picture of a rapidly evolving world.
                <p>
                    AI continues to dominate discussions about the future. By 2025, commentators expect AI to play a
                    central role in industries, economies, and daily life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generative AI Expansion: AI tools will become more sophisticated, enabling greater collaboration
                    between humans and machines in areas like design, writing, and problem-solving.
                    Autonomous Systems: Self-driving vehicles and drones may see broader implementation, reshaping
                    transportation and logistics.
                </p>

                    Trump accused the Fed of acting too conservatively, especially when other central banks around the
                    world were pursuing more aggressive monetary easing policies. He believed that lower interest rates
                    would have further boosted the stock market and supported his economic agenda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Legally, the independence of the Federal Reserve is protected, and the President does not have the
                    authority to directly "fire" the Fed Chair. The Chair serves a four-year term and can only be
                    removed "for cause," which would require evidence of misconduct or incompetence. Merely disagreeing
                    with monetary policy decisions does not constitute sufficient grounds for removal.

                    However, Trump’s repeated public pressure on the Fed raised concerns about the erosion of the
                    central bank’s independence. Economic experts warned that politicizing the Fed could undermine its
                    credibility and destabilize financial markets.
