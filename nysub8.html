                <h3>Congestion pricing's first work week winds down in NYC</h3><br>
                <img src="newyorkimages/nysub8.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p> The first work week of congestion pricing is wrapping up in New York City.</p>
                <p>It has been six days since the controversial program got started, which charges most vehicles $9 to
                    drive below 60th Street in Manhattan during peak hours. </p>
                <p>The MTA says it does not have data as yet on how much money the toll has generated in its first week,
                    or how many vehicles have driven into the Central Business District. </p>
                <p>"Is congestion pricing having the effect on the traffic flow that you wanted to see?" CBS News New
                    York's Ali Bauman asked.</p>
                <p>"The anecdotal and the evidence and the reports are pretty consistent, that people coming from buses,
                    whether they're coming from Jersey or on Express buses from the New York City boroughs, are having
                    much faster morning commutes, faster evening commutes," MTA Chair Janno Lieber said. </p>
                <p>Traffic expert "Gridlock" Sam Schwartz has been monitoring GPS data patterns.</p>
                <p>"Traffic at the bridges and tunnels appears to be down. The only crossing that looks like it's a
                    little bit up is the Battery Tunnel," Schwartz said. "I've even been monitoring the Cross Bronx
                    Expressway and Fort Lee that filed the lawsuit, and they're looking pretty good. I don't see any
                    significant difference."</p>
                <p>The MTA says it's too early to tell how effective congestion pricing has been on congestion itself,
                    especially consider the bitter start to January, and it being so soon after the holidays. The MTA
                    expects to release more traffic data in the coming weeks.</p>
