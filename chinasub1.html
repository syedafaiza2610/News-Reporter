                    development</h3><br>

                <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for high-quality audit-based oversight to provide safeguards
                    for the country's high-quality economic and social development.</p>
                <p>Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of
                    the Central Military Commission, made the remarks in a recent instruction on the audit work, which
                    he underscored as an important part of the oversight systems of the Party and the country.</p>
                <p>In recent years, audit authorities have played a positive role in promoting the healthy development
                    of the economy, safeguarding economic security of the country, revealing risks and potential
                    dangers, and advancing the fight against corruption, Xi said.</p>
                <p>Highlighting the centralized and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee on audit work, Xi
                    said audit authorities should focus on their primary responsibilities and core business, deepen
                    reform and innovation, and strengthen self-improvement. He also called for building a centralized
                    and unified audit oversight system that is comprehensive, authoritative and efficient.</p>
                <p>Xi's important instruction was conveyed by Wu Zhenglong, state councilor and secretary-general of the
                    State Council, at the national audit work conference held in Beijing from Friday to Saturday.</p>
                    <p>At the conference, 80 audit institutions and 45 individuals were honored for their excellent performance.</p>
