                <h3>Building a social life post-secondary school</h3>
                <img src="singaporeimages/sg7.avif" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p>The TL;DR: The Straits Times answers five questions new junior college, polytechnic and Institute of
                    Technical<br> Education (ITE) students might have about friendships after graduating from secondary
                    school.</p>
                <p>1. Now that there are no longer fixed classes, is it still important to form meaningful connections?
                    How should<br> one do so?</p>
                <p>Mr Dominic Chan, 19, from ITE College Central, admitted that making friends in secondary school was
                    “much easier”.</p>
                <p>Upon starting at ITE, the Higher Nitec accounting student did not plan on making new friends. But
                    during his<br> first year, Mr Chan realised the importance of taking the initiative to socialise
                    with
                    his peers.</p>
                <p>For a business ethics module, he was grouped with others who were unable to find a group. “We
                    were<br>
                    allowed to choose (our teammates) but, unfortunately, at that time I was not familiar with anyone
                    and ended<br> up with strangers,” he said. </p>
                <p>As his teammates did not share the same motivation or work ethic that he had, he had to take on a
                    significant<br> amount of responsibility. Despite his best efforts, the outcome was not as good as he
                    had hoped. </p>
