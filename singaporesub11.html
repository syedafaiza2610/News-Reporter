                <h3>Woman loses $67k after believing scammer’s lie that she wrongly bought<br> WeChat ‘anti-scam insurance’
                </h3>
                <img src="singaporeimages/sg10.avif" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p>SINGAPORE – A woman lost most of her savings after she believed a scammer’s lie that she had
                    mistakenly<br> bought insurance coverage from WeChat and paid $67,500, hoping to cancel the policy.
                </p>
                <p>Impersonating a WeChat employee, the scammer told the victim, 35, that she needed to make several
                    transfers<br> from her bank accounts to “authenticate” the cancellation of this policy..</p>
                <p>Scammers would then contact them through WhatsApp and request a $5 payment as a membership fee or
                    an<br>
                    upfront deposit to be made through a phishing link.</p>
                <p>After keying in their credit or debit card details, the victims would face payment issues.</p>
                <p>Scammers would instruct them to download a malicious application in an Android package kit (APK) file
                    format<br> through WhatsApp to resolve the payment issues.</p>
                <p>An APK is an app solely for Android users. Once downloaded, the malicious APK allows scammers to
                    access<br> and take control of victims’ devices remotely.</p>
                <p>The malware would allow scammers to steal sensitive information such as SMS one-time passwords.<br>
                    They
                    would then perform unauthorised card transactions either from the victims’ mobile device or their
                    own</p>
