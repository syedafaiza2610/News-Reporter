                <h3>Bronx apartment fire leaves 7 hurt, more than 250 displaced</h3><br>
                <img src="newyorkimages/nysub11.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p> A five-alarm fire broke out early Friday morning in the Bronx, leaving seven people hurt and more
                    than 250 needing shelter and emergency assistance.</p>
                <p>Firefighters responded around 1:45 a.m. to a six-story apartment building at 2910 Wallace Avenue in
                    the Allerton section of the borough. Once crews arrived, they determined the fire was coming from
                    the top floor of the building. Within an hour, it quickly grew to five alarms.</p>
                <p>According to PATH, the increase is the result of inflation, the need for capital improvements and to
                    make up for a $3 billion loss during the COVID pandemic. </p>

                <p>A single ride on the PATH costs $3.00 after the 25-cent fare hike. A 10-trip card costs $28.50 after
                    a $2.50 bump, and a 30-day pass is now $120.75, which is $10.50 more. </p>
                <p>Seniors are eligible for a discounted $1.50 fare. For the first time, disabled passengers are
                    eligible for a 50% fare discount. </p>
                <p> All Hallows High School and its legacy that started in the early 20th century could come to an end
                    if the Catholic school in the Bronx can't come up with $2.5 million.</p>
                <p>While All Hallows High School is half way to its goal, many in the South Bronx community are
                    devastated over the prospects of losing it. The school has until Jan. 16 to come up with the funds,
                    otherwise it would shut down at the end of the academic year.</p>
