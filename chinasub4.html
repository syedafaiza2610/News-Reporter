                <img src="images/chinasub4.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br><br>
                <p>Chinese citizens coming to Thailand should be vigilant not to fall into the trap of "high-paying
                    recruitment," reminded the Chinese Embassy in Thailand on Saturday.</p>
                <p>Chinese citizens coming to Thailand should not easily believe in false promises such as "high-paying
                    jobs" and "free air tickets and accommodation" to avoid being deceived, said the statement.</p>
                <p>The Chinese embassy confirmed on Friday that the Chinese citizen surnamed Wang departed from Thailand
                    for China on Friday night following collaborative efforts from both countries.</p>
                <p>The Chinese embassy expressed its gratitude to the Thai government for prioritizing Wang's case,
                    which was caused by cyber-fraud, and for promptly launching a rescue operation that ensured his safe
                    return.</p>
                <p>Wang Xing, a Chinese actor, entered Thailand on January 3, but lost contact near the Thailand-Myanmar
                    border. The Thai police tracked his movements and successfully rescued him on Tuesday, identifying
                    him as a victim of human trafficking.</p>
                <p>The incident has drawn widespread public concern in both China and Thailand.</p>
                <p>Thailand's Senior Inspector General Thatchai Pitaneelaboot shared details about the Chinese actor's
                    rescue work in an interview on Thursday.</p>
                <p>The investigation revealed that Wang had received a job offer and traveled to Thailand, where he was
                    picked up by a vehicle arranged by his "recruiter" after arriving at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok
                    on January 3, 2025.</p>
                <p>Wang took photos of the vehicle's license plate and key landmarks on the way, sending them to his
                    girlfriend in China, Thatchai said, adding that Wang didn't realize that he might have been deceived
                    until he was brought across a river into rural Myanmar and found himself landed in a raw environment
                    where there were no recreational facilities at all.</p>
