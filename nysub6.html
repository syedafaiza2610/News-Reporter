                <p> â€” Senior citizens in Brighton Beach say they're fed up after paying thousands of dollars a year for
                    parking spots that are often taken by unauthorized drivers.</p>
                <p>Now, lawmakers are trying to do something about it.</p>
                <h3>"It's outrageous"</h3>
                <p>Fran Schwartz, 81, has lived in Brighton Beach almost her whole life. She pays the Department of
                    Transportation for a quarterly parking permit at the municipal lot on Brighton 4th Street, steps
                    away from the boardwalk, but says other cars are shirking the system and parking in other people's
                    spots for free. </p>
                <p>"They say, 'I'm sorry.' What do you mean, 'I'm sorry?' I have a permit. So what, if you have a
                    permit, there's no one to tell me what to do," she recalls a common interaction</p>
                <p>Fed up by this, she brought the issue to the attention of Democratic State Sen. Jessica
                    Scarcella-Spanton and Republican Councilwoman Inna Vernikov. </p>
