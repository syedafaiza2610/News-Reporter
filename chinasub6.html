                <p>What’s the first news event or viral video that springs to mind when you think back to China in 2024?
                    And how about the United States?</p>
                <p>The moment that stands out for me came in November, when a recipient of Chinese national gift
                    porcelain, Evan Kail from the United States, came to China to experience the country firsthand. I've
                    been following Evan’s story for two years – he’s used his “accidental fame” to make a big
                    contribution to exchanges between young Chinese and American people.</p>
                <p>For those who don’t know him, Evan Kail – also known as Pawn Man – is an American social media
                    influencer who runs a coins and collectibles shop in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Two years ago, a
                    customer sent him a WWII-era photo album documenting Japan's invasion of China. He posted a TikTok
                    video about it that garnered worldwide attention, sparked numerous online discussions and changed
                    Evan’s life.</p>
                <p>“At first, I was hailed as a hero after claiming to have uncovered unseen evidence of the Nanjing
                    Massacre, an event in 1937 that historians have rightly dubbed a ‘forgotten holocaust.’ But within
                    48 hours, the tide turned, and I found myself branded as a hoaxer. Speculation about my ‘sinister’
                    intentions ran rampant. People said I was using a war crime to fuel my own fame.”</p>
                <p>Two months later, Evan donated the album to the consulate general of China in Chicago, and was gifted
                    state porcelain as a token of appreciation. Only three individual foreigners have received China’s
                    national gift: Henry Norman Bethune, John Rabe and Evan Kail.</p>
