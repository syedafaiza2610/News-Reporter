                <h3>Flu surge in China declines below 2024 levels, health official says</h3>
                <br>
                <img src="images/chinasub8.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br><br>
                <p>The rise in flu cases across China is slowing, according to a health official citing disease control
                    statistics.</p>
                <p>The rate of positive flu virus tests in hospitals nationwide increased by 3.8 percent, lower than the
                    rate of increase during the same period in 2024, said Hu Qiangqiang, spokesperson for China's
                    National Health Commission (NHC), at a press conference in Beijing on Sunday.</p>
                <p>"Current flu activity will gradually decrease later this month, although the situation may vary in
                    different parts of the country," Hu added.</p>
                <p>The NHC, which is coordinating the response to the flu season, has reported no shortage of medical
                    resources, confirming that the supply and production of key medicines remain stable, Hu told
                    reporters.</p>
                <p>Some media outlets and social media accounts reported a surge of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in
                    China in December 2024, incorrectly calling HMPV a "new virus." HMPV has existed for decades and was
                    discovered by researchers in the 2000s. Experts, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the World
                    Health Organization have debunked these inaccurate reports.</p>
                <p>Parents are still urged to take precautions to protect their children from various respiratory
                    diseases, particularly in northern China, where winter respiratory illnesses are common.</p>
                <p>"From our observations at Beijing Children's Hospital, there is no abnormal increase in patients
                    [numbers]," said Xu Baoping, a senior doctor at the hospital, when asked by CGTN about the flu
                    season's impact on children. The number of patients in the recent two months has been lower than
                    last year's, according to Xu.</p>
                <p>Xu also warned that children recovering from one flu strain may still contract another. "Although the
                    flu symptoms are gone, the child's immune system takes longer to recover," Xu explained.
