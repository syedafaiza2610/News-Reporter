                <p class="mt-3">Sir Keir Starmer has been urged to sack anti-corruption minister Tulip Siddiq after she
                    was named in
                    an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to Â£3.9bn from infrastructure spending in
                    Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>Tory leader Kemi Badenoch posted on X on Saturday that it was time for Siddiq to be sacked, adding
                    the PM had "appointed his personal friend as anti-corruption minister and she is accused herself of
                    corruption".</p>
                <p>Siddiq was appointed economic secretary to the Treasury last July and her responsibilities include
                    tackling corruption in UK financial markets.</p>
                <p>The 42-year-old MP for Hampstead and Highgate has referred herself to the PM's standards adviser and
                    insists she has done nothing wrong.</p>
                <p>It comes as Bangladesh's new leader, Muhammad Yunus, told the Sunday Times Siddiq should apologise
                    after reports she had lived in London properties with links to her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, who was
                    deposed as prime minister of Bangladesh last year and is at the centre of a corruption probe.

                </p>
                <p>In a letter to Sir Laurie Magnus, who polices standards among government ministers, Siddiq said: "I am clear that I have done nothing wrong."
