                <h3>Malaysian pedestrian seriously hurt after he was hit by Singapore car<br> on Causeway</h3>
                <img src="singaporeimages/sg2.avif" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p>SINGAPORE – A Malaysian man crossing the Causeway on foot on Jan 12 has been hospitalised with
                    serious<br> injuries after he was hit by a Singapore-registered car, said Malaysian police on Jan
                    13.
                </p>
                <p>The Singaporean driver lost control of his vehicle in the rain, causing the car to skid and crash
                    into a road divider<br> before hitting the pedestrian, said Johor Bahru Southern District police
                    chief
                    Raub Selamat.</p>
                <p>The incident occurred at 5.38pm on Jan 12, with the Malaysian man surnamed Tan walking back to Johor
                    Bahru<br> from Singapore.
                </p>
                <p>A bird’s-eye view video of the incident that was posted online shows a light-coloured vehicle moving
                    towards<br> Malaysia on the Causeway and then skidding before its side hit a person wearing black.
                </p>
                <p>Others also shared online photos of the man visibly wounded and lying on the road before he was taken
                    away<br> by an ambulance.</p>
                <p>According to Assistant Commissioner Raub, the pedestrian suffered serious injuries and is receiving
                    treatment<br> at Hospital Sultanah Aminah in Johor Bahru.</p>
                <p>He added that another person in the car, also a Singaporean, suffered an injury to his left arm. Both<br>
                    Singaporeans are in their 20s. The driver is assisting with investigations.</p>
