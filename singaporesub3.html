                <h3>KFC’s Mofusand keychains resold by scalpers for as much as $50 on<br> Carousell on first day of
                    promotion</h3>

                <p>SINGAPORE - Fans of a dewy-eyed cat donning a chicken bucket sold by fast food chain KFC have
                    become<br> the latest target of scalpers.</p>
                <p>The coveted cat keychain is part of a collaboration between KFC and Mofusand, a popular Japanese
                    cat<br>
                    illustration series, which released limited stocks of the trinkets, as well as sticker packs and red
                    packets<br> to dine-in and takeaway customers at 11am on Jan 13 to promote KFC’s cereal chicken.</p>
                <p>For every cereal chicken box or cereal chicken burger box purchased, customers are allowed to buy one
                    keychain<br> for $12.95, with a new design launched each week over three weeks.</p>
                <p>Each customer is limited to two keychains.</p>
                <p>By 4pm, merchandise of the fluffy cat was being resold for up to $50, with The Straits Times finding
                    some 70<br> listings on shopping platform Carousell.</p>
                <p>One reseller even took pre-orders for designs that have not been released, in exchange for $40.</p>
                <p>Sticker packs and red packets, which were given away for free with conditions attached, are priced between<br> roughly $8 and $12 on Carousell.
