                <p>As the host city for the coming ninth Asian Winter Games, Harbin of northeast China's Heilongjiang
                    Province, has launched automated border control systems, or, E-channels, to improve efficiency for
                    both arrivals and departures at the Harbin Taiping International Airport.</p>
                <p>As the first E-channels of the province, the systems were officially put into use on Friday
                    afternoon. Eligible passengers on a flight from Seoul, South Korea, became the first visitors to
                    complete quick entry into China via the E-channels.</p>
                <p>A total of 14 E-channels, including eight for arrivals and six for departures have been set up at the
                    airport, enabling 228 passengers to complete quick arrivals and departures while reducing the
                    workload on regular counters.</p>
                <p>The Harbin Taiping International Airport expects a huge increase of passenger flow considering the
                    approaching of the Asian Winter Games, Spring Festival as well as ice and snow tourism season.
                    Therefore, the launch of E-channels will grow to be more necessary.</p>
                    <p>The ninth Asian Winter Games will begin on February 7 and end on 14.</p>
