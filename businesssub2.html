                <h3>After “Doing Business”</h3><br>
                <img src="business images/b2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br><br>
                <p>Following its recent business-environment rankings scandal, the World Bank will have to overcome a
                    deep trust deficit and take drastic steps to restore public confidence in its data. Any new efforts
                    it undertakes in this area should meet four minimum criteria..</p>
                <p>WASHINGTON, DC – Earlier this year, the World Bank commissioned me and five fellow academics to
                    develop recommendations on how to improve the methodology behind its annual Doing Business report,
                    which ranked countries on the quality of their business regulations and their overall business
                    environment. The report had been a lightning rod for controversy since its inception in 2003. While
                    it generated glowing coverage in the global business media, it was also subject to constant
                    criticism for its perceived anti-regulation, anti-union, and anti-tax slant.</p>

                <p>On September 1, we submitted our final recommendations, calling for a major overhaul of Doing
                    Business including ending the practice of ranking countries. Two weeks later, the World Bank
                    announced that it was scrapping the report entirely after a separate investigation by an outside law
                    firm concluded that data had been deliberately manipulated in order to alter some countries’
                    rankings, notably those of China and Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>The embrace of short-termism by corporations – reflected in their preference for dividends and share
                    buybacks over reinvestment of profits – has further undermined the EU manufacturing sector’s
                    dynamism and resilience. Compounding all these challenges is the biggest crisis of them all –
                    climate change – which is generating rapidly increasing financial and human costs.</p>
                <p>The impact on European industry is already apparent. In 2022, the EU’s trade deficit reached a
                    staggering €432 billion ($465 billion), driven by both higher spending on energy imports and
                    manufacturing losses linked to the energy crisis. In February 2024, industrial production fell by
                    6.4% in the euro area and by 5.4% in the EU year on year.</p>
