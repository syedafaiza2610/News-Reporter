                <h3>There Can Be No Business as Usual for European Industry</h3><br>
                <img src="business images/b1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br><br>
                <p>The choices EU leaders make in the coming years will determine whether European industry has a
                    long-term future. That is why the next European Parliament must make implementing a renewed European
                    Green Deal, complemented by initiatives to bolster industry and attract broad public support, a top
                    priority.</p>
                <p>RUSSELS – A month before the European Parliament elections, many of Europe’s industries are fighting
                    to survive. But rather than make the difficult decisions needed to reverse the European Union’s
                    industrial decline, leaders have often settled for the status quo. Some populist leaders even oppose
                    plans to modernize Europe’s industrial base – effectively deceiving the public in the process.</p>
                <p>Europe’s manufacturing sector has faced a series of unprecedented challenges in recent years. The
                    COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war laid bare Europe’s reliance on others for critical goods and
                    dealt serious blows to manufacturing by disrupting supply chains and triggering energy and
                    cost-of-living crises.</p>
                <p>The embrace of short-termism by corporations – reflected in their preference for dividends and share
                    buybacks over reinvestment of profits – has further undermined the EU manufacturing sector’s
                    dynamism and resilience. Compounding all these challenges is the biggest crisis of them all –
                    climate change – which is generating rapidly increasing financial and human costs.</p>
                <p>The impact on European industry is already apparent. In 2022, the EU’s trade deficit reached a
                    staggering €432 billion ($465 billion), driven by both higher spending on energy imports and
                    manufacturing losses linked to the energy crisis. In February 2024, industrial production fell by
                    6.4% in the euro area and by 5.4% in the EU year on year.</p>
