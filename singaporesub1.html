                <h3>HR professionals prepare for changes due to workplace fairness Bill</h3>
                <img src="singaporeimages/sg1.avif" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p>SINGAPORE - Human resources (HR) groups have given their thumbs-up for the landmark Bill tackling
                    workplace discrim<br> that was passed in Parliament on Jan 8, giving workers greater protection
                    against biases on grounds like age, race and nationality.</p>
                <p>But they noted that more can be done to better protect workers’ rights, especially for smaller
                    businesses with fewer than 25<br> employees, which will be excluded from the legislation for five
                    years
                    after it comes into effect.</p>
                <p>The Workplace Fairness Bill specifies that it is unlawful to make employment decisions, such as
                    hiring, firing and appraisals,<br> based on five sets of characteristics:</p>
                <p>Under the legislation, employers will also have to set up grievance-handling processes and inform
                    employees about the procedures.</p>
                <p>Employers must conduct inquiries, document the process and communicate the outcome to aggrieved
                    employees, whose<br> confidentiality must also be assured.</p>
                <p>The legislation will prohibit retaliation – such as dismissals, salary deductions or harassment –
                    against staff who report workplace<br> discrimination.</p>
                <p>In response to the Bill, Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP) chief executive Aslam
                    Sardar said small and<br> medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly those without dedicated HR
                    functions, may face challenges in implementing<br> the processes, due to the lack of guidance and
                    resources.
