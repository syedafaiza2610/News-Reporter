                </p>

                <p>
                    The decision to host the tournament in Oman underscores the country's commitment to promoting hockey
                    and fostering a vibrant sports culture. With its modern infrastructure and growing reputation as a
                    host for international events, Oman is poised to deliver an exceptional experience for players,
                    officials, and fans. The tournament will be held at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex, a
                    state-of-the-art facility that has previously hosted a range of high-profile sports events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The FIH Hockey Nations Cup 2 is a vital step in the development of global hockey, offering
                    participating nations the opportunity to gain exposure and experience against competitive teams. The
                    event also serves as a pathway for promotion to higher levels of international competition, making

                <p>
                    This historic moment not only thrilled fans but also solidified the legacy of Shan Masood and Babar
                    Azam as one of the most formidable opening pairs in cricket. Their achievement will be remembered as
                    a shining example of skill, partnership, and the spirit of the game.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Babar Azamâ€™s innings was a testament to his status as one of the best batsmen in modern cricket. His
                    exquisite timing, ability to find gaps, and consistency under pressure were on full display. Shan
                    Masood, too, proved his mettle, anchoring the innings with determination and capitalizing on scoring
                    opportunities with precision.
