                <p>- New York could become the next state to offer universal free school meals under a plan proposed by
                    Gov. Kathy Hochul. </p>
                <p>They say there's no such thing as a free lunch. But if Hochul gets her way, all 2.7 million students
                    in the Empire State would get free breakfast and lunch at school. </p>
                    <p>"In the wealthiest country in the world, this can no longer be tolerated. Not in America and definitely not in the great state of New York," the governor said. </p>
                    <h3>Free school meals plan would end income requirements 
                    </h3>
                    <p>Hochul announced her free school meals on Friday, as part on her efforts to make the state more affordable, before next week's State of the State Address.</p>
                    <p>The governor said she will ask lawmakers to approve free meals for all students, regardless of income, in her speech, because students perform better with full bellies.</p>
