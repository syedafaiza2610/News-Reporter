                <img src="singaporeimages/sg4.avif" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p>SINGAPORE – A water pipe that burst recently in the Phoenix Park office campus has cut off the water
                    supply<br> for offices and businesses there.</p>
                <p>A pre-school, enrichment centres, a yoga studio and a tailoring business are among affected
                    businesses in the<br> cluster of 11 colonial buildings located in Tanglin Road.</p>
                <p>The 59,630 sq m site, which used to house the former Ministry of Home Affairs office, is managed by
                    the<br> Singapore Land Authority (SLA).</p>
                <p>According to an e-mail sent to tenants on the morning of Jan 11, an underground pipe had burst,
                    causing water<br> leaks.</p>
                <p>It was sent by facilities management company Ocean IFM, a contractor hired by master tenant LHN
                    Group,<br> which offers real estate management services and leases out the majority of the units in
                    Phoenix Park office <br>campus to sub-tenants.</p>
                <p>The e-mail added that the water supply was disrupted, and that repairs works were taking place.</p>
                <p>On the morning of Jan 13, Ocean IFM sent another e-mail notifying LHN Group’s sub-tenants that the
                    water<br> disruption would continue on that day, “due to unforeseen circumstances and bad weather
                    conditions”.</p>
