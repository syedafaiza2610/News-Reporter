                <p> SINGAPORE – Scammers remain a menace, with at least 82 cases of malware<br> scams reported since
                    December 2024 and total losses amounting to about $625,000.</p>
                <p>The victims fell for an emerging variant of the malware scam by responding to fraudulent Facebook and
                    TikTok<br> advertisements for travel and cleaning services, said the police on Jan 10. Victims would
                    leave their contact details<br> to indicate their interest.</p>
                <p>Scammers would then contact them through WhatsApp and request a $5 payment as a membership fee or
                    an<br>
                    upfront deposit to be made through a phishing link.</p>
                <p>After keying in their credit or debit card details, the victims would face payment issues.</p>
                <p>Scammers would instruct them to download a malicious application in an Android package kit (APK) file
                    format<br> through WhatsApp to resolve the payment issues.</p>
                <p>An APK is an app solely for Android users. Once downloaded, the malicious APK allows scammers to
                    access<br> and take control of victims’ devices remotely.</p>
                <p>The malware would allow scammers to steal sensitive information such as SMS one-time passwords.<br> They
                    would then perform unauthorised card transactions either from the victims’ mobile device or their
                    own</p>
