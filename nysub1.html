                <h3>Financially strapped All Hallows High School may close after a century in the Bronx</h3><br>
                <img src="newyorkimages/nysub1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
                <p> All Hallows High School and its legacy that started in the early 20th century could come to an end
                    if the Catholic school in the Bronx can't come up with $2.5 million.</p>
                <p>While All Hallows High School is half way to its goal, many in the South Bronx community are
                    devastated over the prospects of losing it. The school has until Jan. 16 to come up with the funds,
                    otherwise it would shut down at the end of the academic year.</p>
                <p>Last Wednesday's dismissal could be one of the last at All Hallows because leaders of the Catholic
                    school say its facing significant financial struggles. </p>
                <p>Students of the school, which was founded in 1906, are reeling over the thought of it closing.

                </p>
                <p>"It really hurts," senior Xavier Batista said.

                </p>
                <p>"Coming to a school like this, it just felt like family as soon as I came here," senior Sajel Atif
                    said.

                </p>
                <p>Officials say the high school on 164th Street was hit hard by the COVID pandemic. When droves of
                    people left the city, enrollment took a big hit.</p>
                <p>And when the all-girls Catholic high school St. Barnabas in Yonkers closed last year, All Hallows
                    tried to increase the student body by recruiting Barnabas students and going co-ed for the first
                    time in over a century. But even that hasn't been enough.</p>
