                <p>The retail giant Macy's is shutting down 10 stores in New York and New Jersey this year, calling it a
                    turnaround strategy.</p>
                <p>Macy's released a list of 66 stores expected to close during the first quarter of 2025.</p>
                <h3>Which Macy's stores are closing in New York?</h3>
                <p>Five of those stores are located in New York, including:</p>
                <li>Lake Success in New Hyde Park,
                </li>
                <li>Melville Mall in Huntington,

                </li>
                <li>Queens Place in Elmhurst,

                </li>
                <li>Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn,

                </li>
                <li>Mall at Greece Ridge in Rochester,

                </li>
                <p>The Macy's location at the Essex Green Shopping Center in Orange, New Jersey is also on the list.</p>
                <p>Macy's said it's shuttering stores that are "underproductive."</p>
                <h3>New York shoppers upset by Macy's closures</h3>
                <p>The new plan is upsetting some local shoppers.</p>
                <p>"Very sad, I love Macy's," Queens resident Maryann Lattanzin said.</p>
                <p>"I used to work for Macy's, and that was, like, the best job I ever had," Queens resident Amanda
                    Williams said.</p>
