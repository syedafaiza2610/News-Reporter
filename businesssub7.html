                    Although AI has great potential to bring exciting changes to education, art, medicine, robotics,
                    and other fields, it also poses major risks, most of which are not being addressed. Judging by
                    the response so far from political and other institutions, we can safely expect many years of
                    instability.

                    AI-powered tools are already simplifying tasks, from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to
                    personalized recommendations on streaming platforms. In the near future, advancements in natural
                    language processing and machine learning will make these tools more intuitive and responsive,
                    seamlessly blending into our routines.
                <p>
                    The workplace of the future will increasingly rely on AI to drive efficiency and innovation. While
                    some jobs may be automated, new roles will emerge, focusing on AI oversight, ethical considerations,
                    and creative applications.

                    AI is not only optimizing tasks but also entering creative fields like art, music, and writing.
                    Tools like generative AI models are empowering artists, authors, and content creators to push the
                    boundaries of innovation.

                    Trump accused the Fed of acting too conservatively, especially when other central banks around the
                    world were pursuing more aggressive monetary easing policies. He believed that lower interest rates
                    would have further boosted the stock market and supported his economic agenda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Legally, the independence of the Federal Reserve is protected, and the President does not have the
                    authority to directly "fire" the Fed Chair. The Chair serves a four-year term and can only be
                    removed "for cause," which would require evidence of misconduct or incompetence. Merely disagreeing
                    with monetary policy decisions does not constitute sufficient grounds for removal.

                    However, Trump’s repeated public pressure on the Fed raised concerns about the erosion of the
                    central bank’s independence. Economic experts warned that politicizing the Fed could undermine its
                    credibility and destabilize financial markets.
